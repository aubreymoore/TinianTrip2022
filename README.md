## Trip Report

### Objectives

The main objective of this trip was to determine the status of CAS biocontrol agents on Tinian. A secondary objective was to locate and examine cycads growing outside the conservation plots.

### Methods

I visually examined all CAS-infenseted cycads within the conservation plots for CAS parasites and predators with the aid of a hand lens. Data for each plant were recorded by Rowena Mendi and Jason Andrew using Trimble data loggers.

Cycads outside the conservation plots were photographed with GPS coordinates being saved within image files. These plants were examined for presence of CAS, predators and parsites. QGIS was used to compile maps showing plant locations and data were saved in **images.csv**.

### Results

* No CAS predators or parasites were observed on any of the cycads in the conservation plots.
